# Single-Responsibility-Principle
Using the SOLID principles create a program that implement Single Responsibility Principle.

I have two services, Email and UserName Services which will be used and instanciated in UserInvitationHelper class.
The idea behind this Single Responsibility Principle is that a class or entity should do a particular thing and must do it well and each of them has only one reason to change.
